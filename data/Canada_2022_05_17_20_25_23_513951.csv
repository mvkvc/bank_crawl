"Bank of Canada maintains policy rate and forward guidance, adjusts quantitative easing program","\n            The Bank of Canada today held its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent, with the Bank Rate at ½ percent and the deposit rate at ¼ percent. The Bank is maintaining its extraordinary forward guidance on the path for the overnight rate. This is reinforced and supplemented by the Bank’s quantitative easing (QE) program, which is being adjusted to a target pace of $2 billion per week. This adjustment reflects continued progress towards recovery and the Bank’s increased confidence in the strength of the Canadian economic outlook.\nThe global economy is recovering strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic, with continued progress on vaccinations, particularly in advanced economies. However, the recovery is still highly uneven and remains dependent on the course of the virus. The recent spread of new COVID-19 variants is a growing concern, especially for regions where vaccination rates remain low. \nGlobal GDP growth is expected to reach 7 percent this year and then moderate to about 4 ½ percent in 2022 and just over 3 percent in 2023. This is a slightly stronger forecast than the one in the Bank’s April Monetary Policy Report (MPR) and primarily reflects a stronger US outlook. Global financial conditions remain highly accommodative. Rising demand is supporting higher oil prices, while non-energy commodity prices remain elevated. The Canada-US exchange rate is little changed since April.\nIn Canada, the third wave of the virus slowed growth in the second quarter. However, falling COVID-19 cases, progress on vaccinations and easing containment restrictions all point to a strong pickup in the second half of this year. The Bank now expects GDP growth of around 6 percent in 2021 – a little slower than was expected in April – but has revised up its 2022 forecast to 4 ½ percent and projects 3 ¼ percent growth in 2023.\nConsumption is expected to lead the recovery as households return to more normal spending patterns, while housing market activity is projected to ease back from historical highs. Stronger international demand should underpin a solid recovery in exports. As domestic and foreign demand increases and confidence improves, business investment will gain strength. Employment has once again begun to rebound, and we expect the hardest-hit segments of the labour market to post strong gains as the economy re-opens. However, the pace of the recovery will vary among industries and workers, and it could take some time to hire workers with the right skills to fill jobs. The aftermath of lockdowns and ongoing structural changes in the economy both mean that estimates of potential output and when the output gap will close are particularly uncertain.\nCPI inflation was 3.6 percent in May, boosted by temporary factors that include base-year effects and stronger gasoline prices, as well as pandemic-related bottlenecks as economies re-open. Core measures of inflation have also risen but by less than the CPI. In some high-contact services, demand is rebounding faster than supply, pushing up prices from low levels. Transitory supply constraints in shipping and value chain disruptions for semiconductors are also translating into higher prices for cars and some other goods. With higher gasoline prices and on-going supply bottlenecks, inflation is likely to remain above 3 percent through the second half of this year and ease back toward 2 percent in 2022, as short-run imbalances diminish and the considerable overall slack in the economy pulls inflation lower. The factors pushing up inflation are transitory, but their persistence and magnitude are uncertain and will be monitored closely.\nThe Governing Council judges that the Canadian economy still has considerable excess capacity, and that the recovery continues to require extraordinary monetary policy support. We remain committed to holding the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. In the Bank’s July projection, this happens sometime in the second half" <> ...

"Bank of Canada maintains commitment to current level of policy rate, continues program of quantitative easing","\n            The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at the effective lower bound of ¼ percent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly ½ percent and the deposit rate is ¼ percent. The Bank is also continuing its quantitative easing (QE) program, with large-scale asset purchases of at least $5 billion per week of Government of Canada bonds.\nBoth the global and Canadian economies are evolving broadly in line with the scenario in the July Monetary Policy Report (MPR), with activity bouncing back as countries lift containment measures. The Bank continues to expect this strong reopening phase to be followed by a protracted and uneven recuperation phase, which will be heavily reliant on policy support. The pace of the recovery remains highly dependent on the path of the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolution of social distancing measures required to contain its spread.\nThe rebound in the United States has been stronger than expected, while economic performance among emerging markets has been more mixed. Global financial conditions have remained accommodative. Although prices for some commodities have firmed, oil prices remain weak.\nIn Canada, real GDP fell by 11.5 percent (39 percent annualized) in the second quarter, resulting in a decline of just over 13 percent in the first half of the year, largely in line with the Bank’s July MPR central scenario. All components of aggregate demand weakened, as expected.\nAs the economy reopens, the bounce-back in activity in the third quarter looks to be faster than anticipated in July. Economic activity has been supported by government programs to replace incomes and subsidize wages. Core funding markets are functioning well, and this has led to a decline in the use of the Bank’s short-term liquidity programs. Monetary policy is working to support household spending and business investment by making borrowing more affordable.\nHousehold spending rebounded sharply over the summer, with stronger-than-expected goods consumption and housing activity largely reflecting pent-up demand. There has also been a large but uneven rebound in employment. Exports are recovering in response to strengthening foreign demand, but are still well below pre-pandemic levels. Business confidence and investment remain subdued. While recent data during the reopening phase is encouraging, the Bank continues to expect the recuperation phase to be slow and choppy as the economy copes with ongoing uncertainty and structural challenges.\nCPI inflation is close to zero, with downward pressure from energy prices and travel services, and is expected to remain well below target in the near term. Measures of core inflation are between 1.3 percent and 1.9 percent, reflecting the large degree of economic slack, with the core measure most influenced by services prices showing the weakest growth.\nAs the economy moves from reopening to recuperation, it will continue to require extraordinary monetary policy support. The Governing Council will hold the policy interest rate at the effective lower bound until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. To reinforce this commitment and keep interest rates low across the yield curve, the Bank is continuing its large-scale asset purchase program at the current pace. This QE program will continue until the recovery is well underway and will be calibrated to provide the monetary policy stimulus needed to support the recovery and achieve the inflation objective.\nInformation note\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is October 28, 2020. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time.\n\n        "
"Tiff Macklem Appointed Governor of the Bank of Canada","\n            The Directors of the Bank of Canada, appointed under Section 9 of the Bank of Canada Act, today announced that they have appointed Tiff Macklem as Governor of the Bank of Canada for a seven-year term, effective 3 June 2020. Mr. Macklem will succeed Stephen S. Poloz, who is leaving the Bank of Canada on 2 June 2020.\n\"After pursuing an exhaustive domestic and international selection process for this crucial role, I'm delighted to say that Tiff Macklem has the exceptional qualities to fulfil this role,” said Claire Kennedy, Chair of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors. \"Tiff has deep knowledge of monetary policy and financial stability issues, a proven crisis management track record, and extensive senior leadership experience. We are confident Tiff will make an outstanding contribution to promoting the economic and financial welfare of Canada, and to upholding the Bank’s exemplary reputation as a leading central bank.”\nA native of Montréal, Quebec, Mr. Macklem has been Dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto since July 2014. Prior to that, he served as the Senior Deputy Governor at the Bank of Canada between July 2010 and May 2014. Before his appointment as Senior Deputy Governor, Mr. Macklem was Associate Deputy Minister at the Department of Finance, serving as Canada's representative at the G7, G20 and Financial Stability Board. Mr. Macklem first joined the Bank in 1984 and occupied increasingly senior positions until he was appointed Advisor to the Governor in August 2003. In 2003-4, he was seconded to the Department of Finance, before returning to the Bank as Deputy Governor in December 2004. Mr. Macklem graduated from Queen's University in 1983 with a bachelor's degree in economics, and completed a master’s degree and a PhD in economics from the University of Western Ontario.\nOn behalf of the directors, Ms. Kennedy thanked Governor Poloz for his dedicated service and his leadership in promoting the economic and financial well being of Canada throughout his tenure. She also thanked him for the important contributions he has made to the global policy dialogue, which are being brought to bear in the current challenging circumstances. On behalf of Canadians, the Board expressed its appreciation for Governor Poloz's distinguished career at the Bank of Canada, the legacy of which will continue to serve our country well.\n        "

"Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate target at 1 ¾ percent","\n            The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at 1 ¾ percent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 2 percent and the deposit rate is 1 ½ percent.\nThe Bank’s October projection for global economic growth appears to be intact. There is nascent evidence that the global economy is stabilizing, with growth still expected to edge higher over the next couple of years. Financial markets have been supported by central bank actions and waning recession concerns, while being buffeted by news on the trade front. Indeed, ongoing trade conflicts and related uncertainty are still weighing on global economic activity, and remain the biggest source of risk to the outlook. In this context, commodity prices and the Canadian dollar have remained relatively stable.\nGrowth in Canada slowed in the third quarter of 2019 to 1.3 percent, as expected. Consumer spending expanded moderately, underpinned by stronger wage growth. Housing investment was also a source of strength, supported by population growth and low mortgage rates. The Bank continues to monitor the evolution of financial vulnerabilities related to the household sector. As expected, exports contracted, driven by non-energy commodities. However, investment spending unexpectedly showed strong growth, notably in transportation equipment and engineering projects. The Bank will be assessing the extent to which this points to renewed momentum in investment.\nCPI inflation in Canada remains at target, and measures of core inflation are around 2 percent, consistent with an economy operating near capacity. Inflation will increase temporarily in the coming months due to year-over-year movements in gasoline prices. The Bank continues to expect inflation to track close to the 2 percent target over the next two years.\nBased on developments since October, Governing Council judges it appropriate to maintain the current level of the overnight rate target. Future interest rate decisions will be guided by the Bank’s continuing assessment of the adverse impact of trade conflicts against the sources of resilience in the Canadian economy – notably consumer spending and housing activity. Fiscal policy developments will also figure into the Bank’s updated outlook in January.\nInformation note\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is January 22, 2020. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time.\n\n        "

"Vulnerabilities in the Canadian financial system remain elevated, but elements for improvement are emerging","\n            The high level of household indebtedness and housing market imbalances remain the most important vulnerabilities identified by the Bank of Canada in its Financial System Review (FSR), published today. While these vulnerabilities are still elevated, improving economic conditions and recent changes to housing policy should support an easing of these vulnerabilities over time.\n“Our financial system continues to be resilient, and is being bolstered by stronger growth and job creation, but we need to continue to watch financial vulnerabilities closely,” said Governor Stephen S. Poloz.\nWhile household debt relative to income continues to rise, there have been notable shifts in mortgage activity over the past year, including an improvement in the quality of new high-ratio mortgages (those with a down payment of less than 20 per cent).\nAt the same time, some indicators suggest increasing risks associated with new low-ratio mortgages, such as a greater proportion of these mortgages being issued to highly indebted households. Recent changes to guidelines for low-ratio mortgages will take effect in January 2018 and are expected to mitigate some of these risks over time.\nThe Bank of Canada continues to monitor housing market imbalances closely, particularly for signs of extrapolative expectations. In both the Greater Toronto Area and the Greater Vancouver Area, economic fundamentals, combined with limited supply, continue to support house price growth. However, housing policy measures, together with higher mortgage rates, are expected to weigh on housing activity.\nA third vulnerability highlighted in the FSR concerns cyber threats and the interconnectedness of the financial system. Through the Bank’s oversight of critical financial market infrastructures, it imposes high standards for risk resilience. In this context, the Bank is working with industry and public sector partners to reinforce the resilience of core payment systems and to ensure that key financial system participants can recover quickly in the event of a cyberattack.\nThe risk scenarios summarized in this FSR are the same as in June.\nThe November issue also features two reports written by Bank of Canada staff:\n\nShoring Up the Foundations for a More Resilient Banking System: The Development of Basel III \nAnalysis of Household Vulnerabilities Using Loan-Level Mortgage Data\n\n\n        "
"Release of the Financial System Review","\n            Good morning. Thank you for coming here to the Bank of Canada. Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins and I are happy to be with you to talk about the latest issue of the Bank’s Financial System Review (FSR), which we published today.\nI will start with a reminder about the purpose of the FSR. In it, we identify key vulnerabilities in the financial system, which can interact with and magnify economic shocks. We monitor the evolution of these vulnerabilities, and we look at their potential implications for the financial system and economy if a significant shock were to occur.\nThe most important vulnerabilities for the financial system remain the high level of household indebtedness and imbalances in housing markets. These vulnerabilities continue to be elevated and it will take a long time for them to return to more sustainable levels. A stronger economy and sound policies are working in the same direction to help bring about a gradual easing of these vulnerabilities, and this trend should continue. Let me give you some details.\nSince our last report in June, household debt has continued to rise more quickly than household income. Borrowing for mortgages and home equity lines of credit is driving this growth. Further, we see that households with the highest debt relative to their income are carrying a growing share of the total. That said, new and pending rules for housing finance should help mitigate this vulnerability.\nLast year, the government introduced stricter rules for high-ratio mortgages—that is, where the down payment is less than 20 per cent of the value of the home. These rules are continuing to improve the quality of new high-ratio mortgages. Fewer of these mortgages are being issued, particularly among highly indebted households.\nHowever, we have become increasingly concerned about low-ratio mortgages—those where the down payment is more than 20 per cent of the value of the home. We are continuing to see an increase in new low-ratio mortgages that have riskier characteristics. More of these are being taken out by highly indebted households, and a growing share of borrowers is choosing an amortization period longer than 25 years. Last month, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions announced enhanced guidelines for low-ratio mortgages that are similar to the changes announced for mortgage insurance last autumn. There will be restrictions on borrowing from multiple sources to finance a purchase, and borrowers will have to show that they could handle higher interest rates. That is just good practice for anybody who is taking on new debt.\nWhile we can be confident that the new rules will help mitigate this vulnerability, their precise impact will depend on how both borrowers and lenders respond. We will be watching this closely when the guidelines come into effect next year.\nAnother important development since June is the Bank’s tightening of monetary policy through two interest-rate increases, which came in the context of improving economic fundamentals. The effect of these moves on mortgages is complex. Roughly 15 per cent of borrowers have floating-rate mortgages, and they felt the impact immediately. However, interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages only change when they are renewed, and about half of all mortgages will not reset for more than a year. Some of those that will reset next year could even see their interest rate decline, depending on their term. Improvements in the labour market, particularly stronger wage growth, should help households adjust to higher interest rates. But clearly, this is another area we will watch closely.\nThe second vulnerability, imbalances in the housing market, has also been affected by recent changes in government policy. Price growth has slowed in the Greater Toronto Area after the Ontario government introduced policies aimed at housing affordability. This slowing pulled down national house price growth to an annual rate of 10 per cent.\nThe Toronto-area market is following a pattern similar to what took place in the Greater Vancouver Area last year, w" <> ...

"#bankNOTEable Canadian woman will be revealed on 8 December, Bank of Canada publishes short list of five","\n            On Thursday, 8 December 2016, the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Bank of Canada will reveal which iconic Canadian woman will be featured on the next regularly circulating bank note, expected in 2018.\nIn advance of that announcement, the Bank today published the short list from which the #bankNOTEable woman will be chosen.\nAn independent Advisory Council short-listed these five iconic Canadian women earlier this year for consideration by the Minister of Finance.\nThey are (in alphabetical order):\n\nViola Desmond (1914–1965)\nE. Pauline Johnson (1861–1913)\nElizabeth (Elsie) MacGill (1905–1980)\nFanny (Bobbie) Rosenfeld (1904–1969)\nIdola Saint-Jean (1880–1945)\n\nThe women were selected from 461 eligible nominees submitted by Canadians during an open call for nominations, launched by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on International Women’s Day, 8 March 2016.\nMore than 26,300 submissions were received from Canadians over a five-week period. The Advisory Council initially reduced these nominations to a long list of 12 women, guided by the following principles: Canada is comprised of many different communities; the women who appear on the long list should resonate with Canadians and reflect the diversity of Canada; and their achievements must be seen in the context of the time in which they lived.\nIn compiling their short list, Advisory Council members agreed that these five women best articulated the Council’s ultimate selection criteria: that nominees should have broken or overcome barriers, made a significant change, left a lasting legacy, and be inspirational.\n“The Advisory Council had the difficult task of selecting only five outstanding Canadian women from a vast field of strong choices, and I commend the members for their excellent work,” said Governor Stephen S. Poloz. “I am also delighted that this entire process encouraged a meaningful conversation among Canadians about the many exceptional women who have shaped our country.”\n“Canadian women made our country what it is today, and they deserve a place on our currency,” said Minister of Finance Bill Morneau. “Thanks to the work of the Council members and to the thousands who participated in the conversation, a new generation of young women and girls will be inspired by the stories of those who contributed so much to our society, our values and our history. And, in 2018, we will all have a constant reminder of these exceptional accomplishments to carry around with us wherever we go.”\n        "

"Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate target at 1/2 per cent","\n            The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/2 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 3/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent.\nThe global economy is evolving largely as the Bank projected in its April Monetary Policy Report (MPR). In the United States, despite weakness in the first quarter, a number of indicators, including employment, point to a return to solid growth in 2016. Financial conditions remain accommodative, with ongoing geopolitical factors contributing to fragile market sentiment. Oil prices are higher, in part because of short-term supply disruptions.\nIn Canada, the economy’s structural adjustment to the oil price shock continues, but is proving to be uneven. Growth in the first quarter of 2016 appears to be in line with the Bank’s April projection, although business investment and intentions remain disappointing. The second quarter will be much weaker than predicted because of the devastating Alberta wildfires. The Bank’s preliminary assessment is that fire-related destruction and the associated halt to oil production will cut about 1 1/4 percentage points off real GDP growth in the second quarter. The economy is expected to rebound in the third quarter, as oil production resumes and reconstruction begins. While the Canadian dollar has been fluctuating in response to shifting expectations of US monetary policy and higher oil prices, it is now close to the level assumed in April.\nInflation is roughly in line with the Bank’s expectations. Total CPI inflation has risen recently, largely due to movements in gasoline prices, but remains slightly below the 2 per cent target. Measures of core inflation remain close to 2 per cent, reflecting the offsetting influences of past exchange rate depreciation and excess capacity.\nCanada’s housing market continues to display strong regional divergences, reinforced by the complex adjustment underway in the economy. In this context, household vulnerabilities have moved higher. Meanwhile, the risks to the Bank’s inflation projection remain roughly balanced. Therefore, the Bank’s Governing Council judges that the current stance of monetary policy is still appropriate, and the target for the overnight rate remains at 1/2 per cent.\nInformation note\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 13 July 2016. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at that time. \n\n        "
"Bank of Canada announces appointment of Advisor in New York Office","\n            The Bank of Canada today announced the appointment of Sheryl King as Advisor to the Governor, representing the Bank in its New York Office, effective 5 July 2016.\nReporting to Deputy Governor Lynn Patterson, and working closely with the Consulate General of Canada in New York, Ms. King will promote and strengthen ties between the Bank of Canada and New York’s financial and economic communities, with an emphasis on financial market and financial stability developments. She will also serve as a member of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Review and Financial System Review committees.\n“I am delighted to welcome Sheryl King back to the Bank and to our senior management team,” said Governor Stephen S. Poloz. “Her extensive background in US economic and financial market analysis, together with her well-established professional network in New York and beyond, will benefit the Bank greatly. We look forward to her thoughtful analysis and insightful perspective.”\nA native of Montréal, Ms. King has more than 20 years of experience in macroeconomic strategy, financial markets and central banking. Since 2014, she has been Managing Director North America and Global Quantitative Research at Roubini Global Economics. From 2009 to 2012, Ms. King was Chief Economist and Strategist at Merrill Lynch Canada.\nFrom 2004 to 2009, she was Assistant Chief US Economist at Merrill Lynch in New York.She has also worked as a US macro forecaster and as a bond and currency strategist at TD Bank. Earlier in her career, Ms. King spent eight years at the Bank of Canada, first as an economist and later as an analyst in the Bank’s Financial Markets Department. Ms. King holds a BA in economics from Concordia University and an MA in economics from Carleton University.\n“I am honoured to be returning to the Bank in this unique role, and I look forward to advising the Governor on global market issues while contributing to the institution’s important monetary policy and financial stability work,” Ms. King said.\n        "

"Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate target at 1 per cent","\n            The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent.\nInflation has risen by more than expected. The increase in inflation over the past year is largely due to the temporary effects of a lower Canadian dollar and some sector-specific factors, notably telecommunications and meat prices. Underlying inflation has edged up but remains below 2 per cent.\nThe U.S. economy has clearly strengthened, particularly business investment, which has benefitted Canada’s exports. Growth in the rest of the world, in contrast, continues to disappoint, leading authorities in some regions to deploy further policy stimulus. Oil prices have continued to fall, due to both supply and demand developments. In this context, global financial conditions have eased further.\nCanada's economy is showing signs of a broadening recovery. Stronger exports are beginning to be reflected in increased business investment and employment. This suggests that the hoped-for sequence of rebuilding that will lead to balanced and self-sustaining growth may finally have begun. However, the lower profile for oil and certain other commodity prices will weigh on the Canadian economy.\nThe net effect of these recent developments, together with upward revisions to historical data, is that the output gap appears to be smaller than the Bank had projected in the October Monetary Policy Report (MPR). However, the labour market continues to indicate significant slack in the economy.\nWhile inflation is at a higher starting point relative to the October MPR, weaker oil prices pose an important downside risk to the inflation profile. This is tempered by a stronger U.S. economy, Canadian dollar depreciation, and recent federal fiscal measures. Household imbalances, meanwhile, present a significant risk to financial stability. Overall, the balance of risks remains within the zone for which the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate and therefore the target for the overnight rate remains at 1 per cent.\nInformation note:\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 21 January 2015. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time.\n\n        "

"Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate target at 1 per cent","\n            The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent.\nGlobal economic growth remains modest, although the pace of economic activity varies significantly across the major economies. The U.S. economic expansion is proceeding at a moderate pace, with the continued strengthening in private demand being partly offset by the impact of fiscal consolidation. In Japan, fiscal and monetary policy stimulus is contributing to a rapid recovery in economic growth. In contrast, economic activity in the euro area remains weak. While stronger than in the advanced economies, real GDP growth in China and other emerging market economies has slowed, exerting downward pressure on global commodity prices and, as a consequence, the Bank has downgraded slightly its global growth forecast. The global economy is still expected to pick up in 2014 and 2015.\nIn Canada, economic growth is expected to be choppy in the near term, owing to unusual temporary factors, although the overall outlook is little changed from the Bank’s projection in its April Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Annual GDP growth is projected to average 1.8 per cent in 2013 and 2.7 per cent in both 2014 and 2015, supported by very accommodative financial conditions. Despite ongoing competitiveness challenges, exports are projected to gather momentum, which should boost confidence and lead to increasingly solid growth in business investment. The economy will also be supported by continued growth in consumer spending, while further modest declines in residential investment are expected. Growth in real GDP is projected to be sufficient to absorb the current material excess capacity in the economy, closing the output gap around mid-2015, as projected in the April MPR.\nInflation has been low in recent months and is expected to remain subdued in the near term. The weakness in core inflation reflects persistent material excess capacity, heightened competitive pressures on retailers, relatively subdued wage increases, and some temporary sector-specific factors. Total CPI inflation has also been restrained by declining mortgage interest costs. As the economy gradually returns to full capacity and with inflation expectations well-anchored, both core and total CPI inflation are expected to return to 2 per cent around mid-2015.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent.  As long as there is significant slack in the Canadian economy, the inflation outlook remains muted, and imbalances in the household sector continue to evolve constructively, the considerable monetary policy stimulus currently in place will remain appropriate. Over time, as the normalization of these conditions unfolds, a gradual normalization of policy interest rates can also be expected, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target.\nInformation note:\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 4 September 2013. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on 23 October.\n        "

Tiff and I are pleased to be here with you today to discuss the July Monetary Policy Report, which the Bank published this morning.\n\nGlobal economic growth remains modest, although the pace of economic activity varies significantly across the major economies.\nThe U.S. economic expansion is proceeding at a moderate pace. The continued strengthening in private demand is being partly offset by the impact of fiscal consolidation.\nIn Japan, fiscal and monetary policy stimulus is contributing to a rapid recovery in economic growth.\nIn contrast, economic activity in the euro area remains weak.\nIn China and other emerging market economies, real GDP growth has slowed, although it is stronger than in the advanced economies. This is exerting downward pressure on global commodity prices.\nAnd, as a consequence, the Bank has downgraded slightly its global growth forecast.\nThe global economy is still expected to pick up in 2014 and 2015.\nIn Canada, economic growth is expected to be choppy in the near term, owing to unusual temporary factors. The overall outlook is little changed from the Bank’s projection in April.\nAnnual GDP growth is projected to average 1.8 per cent in 2013 and \n 2.7 per cent in both 2014 and 2015, supported by very accommodative financial conditions.\nDespite ongoing competitiveness challenges, exports are projected to gather momentum. This should boost confidence and lead to increasingly solid growth in business investment. The economy will also be supported by continued growth in consumer spending, while further modest declines in residential investment are expected.\nGrowth in real GDP is projected to be sufficient to absorb the current material excess capacity in the economy, closing the output gap around mid-2015, as projected in April.\nInflation has been low in recent months and is expected to remain subdued in the near term.\nThe weakness in core inflation reflects persistent material excess capacity, heightened competitive pressures on retailers, relatively subdued wage increases, and some temporary sector-specific factors. Total CPI inflation has also been restrained by declining mortgage interest costs.\nAs the economy gradually returns to full capacity and with inflation expectations well-anchored, both core and total CPI inflation are expected to return to 2 per cent around mid-2015.\nThe outlook balances the many upside and downside risks to inflation. Three of the most important emanate from the external environment, and include the risks of stronger U.S. private demand, a failure to contain the crisis in Europe, and weaker growth in China and other emerging-market economies.\nThe most important domestic source of risk to the Canadian economy remains the possibility of a disorderly unwinding of household sector imbalances.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Bank today decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent.  \nAs long as there is significant slack in the Canadian economy, the inflation outlook remains muted, and imbalances in the household sector continue to evolve constructively, the considerable monetary policy stimulus currently in place will remain appropriate. Over time, as the normalization of these conditions unfolds, a gradual normalization of policy interest rates can also be expected, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target.\n\nWith that, Tiff and I would be pleased to take your questions.\n\n        "

"Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate target at 1 per cent ","\n            The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly 1 1/4 per cent and the deposit rate is 3/4 per cent.\nThe global economic recovery is entering a new phase. In advanced economies, temporary factors supporting growth in 2010 - such as the inventory cycle and pent-up demand - have largely run their course and fiscal stimulus will shift to fiscal consolidation over the projection horizon. While the Bank expects that private demand in advanced economies will become sufficiently entrenched to sustain the recovery, the combination of difficult labour market dynamics and ongoing deleveraging in many advanced economies is expected to moderate the pace of growth relative to prior expectations. These factors will contribute to a weaker-than-projected recovery in the United States in particular. Growth in emerging-market economies is expected to ease to a more sustainable pace as fiscal and monetary policies are tightened. Heightened tensions in currency markets and related risks associated with global imbalances could result in a more protracted and difficult global recovery.\nThe economic outlook for Canada has changed. The Bank expects the economic recovery to be more gradual than it had projected in its July Monetary Policy Report, with growth of 3.0 per cent in 2010, 2.3 per cent in 2011, and 2.6 per cent in 2012. This more modest growth profile reflects a more gradual global recovery and a more subdued profile for household spending. With housing activity declining markedly as anticipated and household debt considerations becoming more important, the Bank expects household expenditures to decelerate to a pace closer to the rate of income growth over the projection horizon. Overall, the composition of demand in Canada is expected to shift away from government and household expenditures towards business investment and net exports. The strength of net exports will be sensitive to currency movements, the expected recovery in productivity growth, and the prospects for external demand.\nInflation in Canada has been slightly below the Bank’s July projection. The recent moderation in core inflation is consistent with the persistence of significant excess supply and a deceleration in the growth of unit labour costs. The Bank judges that the output gap is slightly larger and that the economy will return to full capacity by the end of 2012 rather than the beginning of that year, as had been anticipated in July. The inflation outlook has been revised down and both total CPI and core inflation are now expected to converge to 2 per cent by the end of 2012, as excess supply in the economy is gradually absorbed and inflation expectations remain well-anchored.\nReflecting all of these factors, the Bank has decided to maintain the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent. This leaves considerable monetary stimulus in place, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in an environment of significant excess supply in Canada.\nAt this time of transition in the global recovery, with a weaker U.S. outlook, constraints beginning to moderate growth in emerging-market economies, and domestic considerations that are expected to slow consumption and housing activity in Canada, any further reduction in monetary policy stimulus would need to be carefully considered.\nInformation note:\nA full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on 20 October 2010. The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 7 December 2010.\n        "

"Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate target at 1/4 per cent; removes conditional commitment","\n            The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is unchanged at 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent.\nGlobal economic growth has been somewhat stronger than projected, with momentum in emerging-market economies increasing noticeably. Exceptional stimulus from monetary and fiscal policies continues to provide important support in many countries. The recovery in the major advanced economies is still expected to be relatively subdued, reflecting ongoing balance sheet adjustments and the gradual withdrawal of fiscal stimulus commencing later this year. Despite recent progress, considerable uncertainty remains about the durability of the global recovery.\nIn Canada, the economic recovery is proceeding somewhat more rapidly than the Bank had projected in its January Monetary Policy Report (MPR). The profile for growth is more front-loaded than that presented in the January MPR. The Bank now projects that the economy will grow by 3.7 per cent in 2010 before slowing to 3.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.9 per cent in 2012.\nThis profile reflects stronger near-term global growth, very strong housing activity in Canada, and the Bank’s assessment that policy stimulus resulted in more expenditures being brought forward in late 2009 and early 2010 than expected. At the same time, the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar, Canada’s poor relative productivity performance, and the low absolute level of U.S. demand will continue to act as significant drags on economic activity in Canada. The Bank expects the economy to return to full capacity in the second quarter of 2011.\nThe outlook for inflation reflects the combined influences of stronger domestic demand, slowing wage growth, and overall excess supply. Core inflation, which has been somewhat firmer than projected in January, is expected to ease slightly in the second quarter of 2010 as the effect of temporary factors dissipates, and to remain near 2 per cent throughout the rest of the projection period. Total CPI inflation is expected to be slightly higher than 2 per cent over the coming year, before returning to the target in the second half of 2011.\nIn response to the sharp, synchronous global recession, the Bank lowered its target rate rapidly over the course of 2008 and early 2009 to its lowest possible level. With its conditional commitment introduced in April 2009, the Bank also provided exceptional guidance on the likely path of its target rate. This unconventional policy provided considerable additional stimulus during a period of very weak economic conditions and major downside risks to the global and Canadian economies. With recent improvements in the economic outlook, the need for such extraordinary policy is now passing, and it is appropriate to begin to lessen the degree of monetary stimulus. The extent and timing will depend on the outlook for economic activity and inflation, and will be consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target.\nIn accordance with the removal of the conditional commitment, there will be no additional term Purchase and Resale Agreements issued by the Bank.\nInformation note:\nA full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on 22 April 2010. The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 1 June 2010.\n\n        "

"17th Annual Meetings of Gouverneurs des banques centrales des pays francophones","\n            As part of events related to its 75th anniversary, the Bank of Canada hosted the  17th annual meetings of Gouverneurs des banques centrales des pays francophones  in Montréal from 12 to 14 May 2010. In addition to hosting G-7 and G-20 meetings  this year, this forum of central bankers is another example of the spirit of  co-operation and collaboration that Canada brings to the international  community.\nAn initiative organized by the Banque de France in 1994, the meetings of  Gouverneurs des banques centrales des pays francophones are held annually in one  of the member countries of l'Organisation internationale de la francophonie.  This group is composed of 38 central banks representing 54 sovereign countries  (the CBWAS and BCAS represent 14 sub-Saharan African nations). 1\nDuring these meetings, the governors discuss issues of common interest to  their institutions. This year, the governors’ discussions focused on the theme  of Policy Challenges and the Reform Agenda following the Crisis.\nThe discussions explored individual countries’ experiences with  crisis-induced stimulus measures, exit strategies, the role of central banks  with respect to system-wide stability, central bank independence, the future of  the international monetary system, and recent economic developments in the  global economy.\nThe 18th annual meetings will take place in Cambodia in 2011.\n        "
"The New Bank of Canada Commodity Price Index (BCPI)","\n            The Bank of Canada today announced the introduction of a new Bank of Canada  commodity price index (BCPI). 1 In order to  produce a more accurate, representative and flexible index, the methodology used  to construct the index has been changed. Instead of using a fixed-weight price  index in which the weights are updated only infrequently, the new BCPI uses a  chain Fisher price index with weights updated on an annual basis. The new Fisher  BCPI includes a broader set of commodities and is updated using recent commodity  production data.\n\nPlease note that the new Fisher BCPI replaces the previous fixed-weight  series. It is a weighted index of U.S.-dollar prices of commodities produced in  Canada and sold in world markets.\n\nSince the prices of commodities produced in Canada have important  implications for the performance of the Canadian economy, the interpretation of  developments in commodity markets is critical for the conduct of monetary  policy, and an accurate measure of overall movements in prices is essential.\n\nA key advantage of the new Fisher BCPI is the annual updating of the weights  (based on annual production values), so that the new index produces a more  accurate and more relevant measure of commodity price movements. In addition,  its consistency with the Canadian System of National Accounts (which is also  based on chain Fisher indexes) makes the construction of a volume measure for  Canadian commodity production possible.\n\nFurther Information:\n\n\tBank of Canada Discussion Paper No. 2010-6: The Fisher BCPI: The Bank of Canada’s New Commodity Price Index, Ilan Kolet (Bank of Canada) and Ryan Macdonald  (Statistics Canada). \n\tBank of Canada commodity price index. \n\n        "

"Bank of Canada announces appointment of Tiff Macklem as Senior Deputy Governor","\n            The Board of Directors of the Bank of Canada today announced that Tiff Macklem has been appointed Senior Deputy Governor for a term of seven years beginning 1 July, 2010. His selection was made by the independent members of the Bank's Board and was approved by the federal Cabinet.\nMr. Macklem, who has had a long association with the Bank of Canada, is currently Associate Deputy Minister of the federal Department of Finance and Canada's G7 Deputy. In this capacity, he has helped develop measures to mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis and has been closely involved in developing the global response to the crisis through the G7, G20 and the Financial Stability Board.\nGovernor Mark Carney warmly welcomed Mr. Macklem's return to the Bank of Canada in this important position. \"Tiff represents the best traditions of the Bank of Canada. His extensive experience and management approach are ideally suited to the demanding and complex roles of the Senior Deputy Governor. As well as serving as a member of the Governing Council, which oversees the Bank's monetary policy and approaches to financial stability, the Senior Deputy Governor is the Bank's chief operating officer responsible for the effective and efficient operation of the Bank,\" said Governor Carney.\nMr. Macklem, who was born in Montréal, graduated from Queen's University (1983) with a BA in Economics and obtained an MA (1984) and a PhD in Economics (1989) from the University of Western Ontario. In 1984, he joined the Bank of Canada in the Department of Monetary and Financial Analysis. Mr. Macklem occupied increasingly senior positions in the Research Department (now Canadian Economic Analysis) until his appointment as Chief in January 2000. He was appointed Adviser to the Governor in August 2003. In 2003-4, he was seconded to the Department of Finance, returning to the Bank as a Deputy Governor in December 2004. He rejoined Finance as Associate Deputy Minister in 2007.\n        "
"Signs of Thaw in Corporate Attitudes Emerging, Says Governor Carney","\n            With improvements in financial conditions, economic activity, commodity prices,  and confidence, the Bank of Canada anticipates that there will be a relatively  modest recovery this year in business fixed investment in Canada, and an  acceleration of investment spending in 2011. \"The first signs of a thaw in  corporate attitudes have begun to emerge,\" Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney  said in a speech today.\nThe actions of the corporate sector will be critical for the economic  recovery, growth in employment, and competitiveness in Canada. As policy  stimulus begins to fade, a key determinant of the pace and sustainability of  Canada's recovery will be how investment and hiring intentions of businesses in  all sectors evolve.\nThe recent global recession was the worst economic downturn since World War  II, and both its speed and virulence took business by surprise, the Governor  noted. In the future, global economic growth may not only be lower, but it could  also be more volatile. \"Canada is entering this period of adjustment with many  strengths, but the efforts required of us will be historic,\" the Governor told  the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce.\nGovernor Carney acknowledged that businesses in Canada are understandably  waiting for confirmation of the recovery before acting. He cautioned, however,  that action will be needed. \"Companies are emerging from the recession to an  altered world – one that may require deeper restructuring and bolder strategic  initiatives than currently contemplated,\" he stated.\nCanada's corporate sector has advantages, the Governor observed. Domestic  demand is expected to be relatively strong, providing a base of support for some  sectors. Corporate balance sheets are in outstanding shape, and margins have  held up very well. In addition, Canada's overall financial conditions are now  contributing to, rather than retarding, the recovery.\nIn concluding, the Governor reaffirmed the Bank of Canada's commitment to  price stability and to keeping inflation low, stable, and predictable. \"Price  stability lowers uncertainty, minimizes the costs of inflation, reduces the cost  of capital, and creates an environment in which households and firms can invest  and plan for the future,\" he said.\n\n        "
"Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate target at 1/4 per cent and reiterates conditional commitment to hold current policy rate until the end of the second quarter of 2010 ","\n            The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is unchanged at 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent.\nThe ongoing global economic recovery is being driven largely by strong domestic demand growth in many emerging-market economies and supported in advanced economies by exceptional monetary and fiscal stimulus, as well as extraordinary measures taken to support financial systems.\nThe level of economic activity in Canada has been slightly higher than the Bank had projected in its January Monetary Policy Report (MPR). The economy grew at an annual rate of 5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2009, spurred by vigorous domestic spending and further recovery in exports. The underlying factors supporting Canada's recovery are largely unchanged - policy stimulus, increased confidence, improved financial conditions, global growth, and higher terms of trade. At the same time, the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar and the low absolute level of U.S. demand continue to act as significant drags on economic activity in Canada.\nCore inflation has been slightly firmer than projected, the result of both transitory factors and the higher level of economic activity. The outlook for inflation should continue to reflect the combined influences of stronger domestic demand, slowing wage growth, and overall excess supply.\nConditional on the current outlook for inflation, the target overnight rate can be expected to remain at its current level until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target.\nThe risks to the outlook for inflation continue to be those outlined in the January MPR. On the upside, the main risks are stronger-than-projected global and domestic demand. On the downside, the main risks are a more protracted global recovery and persistent strength of the Canadian dollar. The Bank judges that the main macroeconomic risks to the inflation projection are roughly balanced.\nInformation note:\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 20 April 2010.\n A full update of the Bank's outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on 22 April 2010.\n        "
"Bank of Canada maintains overnight rate target at 1/4 per cent and reiterates conditional commitment to hold current policy rate until the end of the second quarter of 2010","\n            The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining its target for the overnight rate at 1/4 per cent. The Bank Rate is unchanged at 1/2 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/4 per cent.\nRecent indicators point to the start of a global recovery from a deep, synchronous recession. Global economic and financial developments have been somewhat more favourable than expected at the time of the July Monetary Policy Report (MPR), although significant fragilities remain.\nA recovery in economic activity is also under way in Canada. This resumption of growth is supported by monetary and fiscal stimulus, increased household wealth, improving financial conditions, higher commodity prices, and stronger business and consumer confidence. However, heightened volatility and persistent strength in the Canadian dollar are working to slow growth and subdue inflation pressures. The current strength in the dollar is expected, over time, to more than fully offset the favourable developments since July.\nGiven all of these factors, the Bank now projects that, relative to the July MPR, the composition of aggregate demand will shift further towards final domestic demand and away from net exports. Growth is expected to be slightly higher in the second half of this year than previously projected but to average slightly lower over the balance of the projection period. The Canadian economy is projected to grow by 3.0 per cent in 2010 and 3.3 per cent in 2011, after contracting by 2.4 per cent this year. This is a somewhat more modest recovery in Canada than the average of previous economic cycles.\nThe Bank now expects that the output gap will be closed in the third quarter of 2011, one quarter later than it had projected in July. Correspondingly, inflation is also expected to return to the 2 per cent target in the third quarter of 2011, one quarter later than in July's projection.\nWhile the underlying macroeconomic risks to the projection are roughly balanced, the Bank judges that, as a consequence of operating at the effective lower bound, the overall risks to its inflation projection are tilted slightly to the downside.\nConditional on the outlook for inflation, the target overnight rate can be expected to remain at its current level until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target. Consistent with this conditional commitment, the Bank will continue to conduct longer-term Purchase and Resale Agreements based on existing terms and conditions and according to the accompanying schedule.\nIn its conduct of monetary policy at low interest rates, the Bank retains considerable flexibility, consistent with the framework outlined in the April MPR.\nInformation note:\nA full update of the Bank's outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on Thursday, 22 October. The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 8 December 2009.\n        "
"The Coming Thaw","\n            It is a pleasure to be here in Winnipeg. Today, I intend to elaborate on  elements of the Bank of Canada's economic outlook.\nAfter putting the recession in context and offering the Bank's perspective on  the shape of the recovery, my remarks will focus on Canada's corporate sector. A  focus on business is appropriate in Manitoba. This province is not only the  geographic centre of our country, but also mirrors Canada's economic diversity.  Manitoba's distinctive blend of primary, manufacturing, and service businesses  represents a true cross-section of the Canadian economy. A focus on business is  also appropriate at this stage of the economic cycle. A key determinant of the  pace and sustainability of Canada's recovery will be how investment and hiring  intentions of businesses in all sectors evolve as policy stimulus begins to  fade.\nMy message is relatively straightforward: the thaw is coming. That may sound  a little premature to someone standing at the corner of Portage and Main in  early February, but it broadly captures the state of our economy. While its pace  will likely be somewhat muted (given the depth of the recession) and while there  may be setbacks, the recovery has begun. After a brutal economic winter, spring  is within sight.\nThere is, however, a catch. The economic climate that Canadian business will  face will be considerably different. Canada is entering this period of  adjustment with many strengths, but the efforts required of us will be  historic.\nThe Global Recession\nIn the fall of 2008, the intensifying financial crisis triggered a deep,  synchronous global recession. The economic shock in the United States was spread  – and in many cases amplified – through trade, finance, and confidence channels.  We are just emerging from the worst economic downturn since World War II.\nThe speed and virulence of the slowdown took business by surprise. Over the  turn of last year, there was the equivalent of a corporate heart attack:  inventories surged, production was slashed, capital spending budgets eliminated,  and employment cut. The cascade of collapsing demand through global supply  chains shook widely held perceptions. Given the shock of the downturn, many  firms understandably have been waiting for confirmation of the recovery before  acting.\nThe Canadian Recession in Context\nCanada experienced a short, sharp recession. In its depths last year, with  the exception of government spending, all major components of aggregate demand  declined. At its worst, industrial production fell 15 per cent. Canadian  exporters suffered particularly, owing to the sharp fall in the components of  U.S. economic activity that matter most for Canada. For example, U.S. demand for  motor vehicles fell by more than half and housing starts by two-thirds. 1 In response to this new profile of U.S. demand, major  Canadian industries (particularly the automotive and forestry sectors) began  deep restructurings, which continue to this day.\nThe recession has had a considerable impact on employment. At its depth,  400,000 Canadians lost their jobs and the unemployment rate spiked by almost 3  percentage points to its highest level in more than a decade. Although the  deterioration of the labour market appears to have stopped, too many Canadians  who want to work are still out of a job, and many of those still employed are  working fewer hours than they would like.\nAs painful as our recession was, Canada has suffered less than most other  advanced economies. Domestic demand, fixed capital investment, and employment in  Canada all held up substantially better than in the United States. Real GDP fell  cumulatively by 3.3 per cent in Canada. That compares with declines of just less  than 4 per cent for the United States, about 5 per cent for the Euro area, 6 per  cent for the United Kingdom, and more than 8 per cent for Japan.\nCanada's better performance can be explained by two factors. First, with a  highly credible monetary policy and the strongest fiscal position in the G-7,  Canadian policy-makers were able to respond " <> ...
"G-20 Reforms Will Support Long-Term Economic Prosperity, says Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney","\n            In the wake of a financial crisis that has cost tens of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in foregone output, Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney called on financial institutions to participate fully in the regulatory reforms of the G-20.\n\"The fundamental objective of the G-20 reforms is to create a resilient, global financial system that efficiently supports worldwide economic growth,\" Governor Carney said in a speech today to the Autorité des marchés financiers. He noted that the implementation of the global reform agenda is just beginning, adding: \"It would be a mistake to underestimate the determination of G-20 leaders to reshape the financial services industry.\"\nThere are two main approaches to financial system reform, Governor Carney said. First, there is a focus on protecting the banks from the economic cycle or, in other words, making each bank more resilient. Second, there is need to protect the cycle from the banks; that is, making the system as a whole more resilient. \"Both are necessary,\" Governor Carney stated.\n\"Our destination should be one where financial institutions and markets play critical – and complementary – roles to support long-term economic prosperity,\" Governor Carney said. \"The system must be robust to shocks, dampening rather than amplifying their impact on the real economy.\"\nIn conclusion, the Governor called for the global financial system to transition from \"its self-appointed role as the apex of economic activity to once again be the servant of the real economy.\" He added that full realization of this objective will require a change in attitude on the part of the global industry. \"Financiers should ask themselves every day how their activities affect systemic risk? and what are they doing to promote economic growth?\" Governor Carney said, urging the sector to demonstrate an awareness of its broader responsibilities.\n\n        "

"Bank of Canada releases Monetary Policy Report","\n            The Bank of Canada today released its April Monetary Policy Report, which discusses current economic and financial trends in the context of Canada's inflation-control strategy.\n\nIn the Report, the Bank noted that in an environment of continued high uncertainty, the global recession has intensified and become more synchronous since the Bank's January Monetary Policy Report Update, with weaker-than-expected activity in all major economies. Deteriorating credit conditions have spread quickly through trade, financial, and confidence channels. While more aggressive monetary and fiscal policy actions are under way across the G20, measures to stabilize the global financial system have taken longer than expected to enact. As a result, the recession in Canada will be deeper than anticipated, with the economy projected to contract by 3.0 per cent in 2009. The Bank now expects the recovery to be delayed until the fourth quarter and to be more gradual. The economy is projected to grow by 2.5 per cent in 2010 and 4.7 per cent in 2011, and to reach its production capacity in the third quarter of 2011. Given significant restructuring in a number of sectors, potential growth has been revised down. The recovery will be importantly supported by the Bank's accommodative monetary stance.\n\nThe Report notes that core inflation is expected to diminish through 2009, gradually returning to the 2 per cent target in the third quarter of 2011 as aggregate supply and demand return to balance. Total CPI inflation is expected to trough at -0.8 per cent in the third quarter of 2009 and return to target in the third quarter of 2011.\n\nWhile the underlying macroeconomic risks to the projection are roughly balanced, the Bank judges that, as a consequence of conducting monetary policy at the effective lower bound, the overall risks to its inflation projection are tilted slightly to the downside.\n\nWith monetary policy now operating at the effective lower bound for the overnight policy rate, it is appropriate to provide more explicit guidance than is usual regarding its future path so as to influence rates at longer maturities. Conditional on the outlook for inflation, the target overnight rate can be expected to remain at its current level until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target. The Bank will continue to provide such guidance in its scheduled interest rate announcements as long as the overnight rate is at the effective lower bound.\n\nTo reinforce its conditional commitment to maintain the overnight rate at 1/4 per cent, the Bank has announced that it will roll over a portion of its existing stock of 1- and 3-month term purchase and resale agreements (PRAs) into 6- and 12-month terms at minimum and maximum bid rates that correspond to the target rate and the Bank Rate, respectively.\n\nAgainst this background, the Bank lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points on Tuesday, 21 April, bringing the cumulative monetary policy easing to 425 basis points since December 2007. It is the Bank's judgment that this cumulative easing, together with the conditional commitment, is the appropriate policy stance to move the economy back to full production capacity and to achieve the 2 per cent inflation target. The Bank retains considerable flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy at low interest rates.\n\nThis is consistent with the framework outlined in today's Monetary Policy Report for conducting monetary policy when the overnight interest rate is at the effective lower bound. The framework sets out the instruments that the Bank would consider using, if required, to achieve its inflation objective. These instruments are: conditional statements about the future path of policy rates; quantitative easing; and credit easing. It also describes principles guiding the possible use of these instruments.\n        "
"Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target by 1/4 percentage point to 1/4 per cent and, conditional on the inflation outlook, commits to hold current policy rate until the end of the second quarter of 2010","\n            The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of a percentage point to 1/4 per cent, which the Bank judges to be the effective lower bound for that rate. The Bank Rate is correspondingly lowered to 1/2 per cent. The deposit rate - the rate paid on deposits held by financial institutions at the Bank of Canada - is left unchanged at 1/4 per cent and provides the floor for the overnight rate. Details of the Bank's operating framework at the effective lower bound can be found here.\nIn an environment of continued high uncertainty, the global recession has intensified and become more synchronous since the Bank's January Monetary Policy Report Update, with weaker-than-expected activity in all major economies.

While the underlying macroeconomic risks to the projection are roughly balanced, the Bank judges that, as a consequence of operating at the effective lower bound, the overall risks to its inflation projection are tilted slightly to the downside.\nWith monetary policy now operating at the effective lower bound for the overnight policy rate, it is appropriate to provide more explicit guidance than is usual regarding its future path so as to influence rates at longer maturities. Conditional on the outlook for inflation, the target overnight rate can be expected to remain at its current level until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target. The Bank will continue to provide such guidance in its scheduled interest rate announcements as long as the overnight rate is at the effective lower bound.\nTo reinforce its conditional commitment to maintain the overnight rate at 1/4 per cent, the Bank will roll over a portion of its existing stock of one- and three-month term Purchase and Resale Agreements (PRAs) into six- and twelve-month terms at minimum and maximum bid rates that correspond to the target rate and the Bank Rate, respectively. These longer-term PRAs will be issued according to the schedule released today.\nToday's decision to lower the policy rate by 25 basis points brings the cumulative monetary policy easing to 425 basis points since December 2007. It is the Bank's judgment that this cumulative easing, together with the conditional commitment, is the appropriate policy stance to move the economy back to full production capacity and to achieve the 2 per cent inflation target. The Bank retains considerable flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy at low interest rates, consistent with the framework to be outlined in the Bank's Monetary Policy Report on 23 April.\nInformation note:\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 4 June 2009.\n\n        "

"Bank of Canada lowers overnight rate target by 1/2 percentage point to 1 per cent","\n            The Bank of Canada today announced that it is lowering its target for the overnight rate by one-half of a percentage point to 1 per cent. The operating band for the overnight rate is correspondingly lowered, and the Bank Rate is now 1 1/4 per cent.\nThe outlook for the global economy has deteriorated since the Bank's December interest rate announcement, with the intensifying financial crisis spilling over into real economic activity. Heightened uncertainty is undermining business and household confidence worldwide and further eroding domestic demand. Major advanced economies, including Canada's, are now in recession and emerging-market economies are increasingly affected. Energy prices have fallen as a result of substantially weaker global demand.\nStabilization of the global financial system is a precondition for economic recovery. To that end, governments and central banks are taking bold and concerted policy actions. There are signs that these extraordinary measures are starting to gain traction, although it will take some time for financial conditions to normalize. In addition, considerable monetary and fiscal policy stimulus is being provided worldwide.\nCanadian exports are down sharply, and domestic demand is shrinking as a result of declines in real income, household wealth, and consumer and business confidence. Canada's economy is projected to contract through mid-2009, with real GDP dropping by 1.2 per cent this year on an annual average basis. As policy actions begin to take hold in Canada and globally, and with support from the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar, real GDP is expected to rebound, growing by 3.8 per cent in 2010.\nA wider output gap through 2009 and modest decreases in housing prices should cause core CPI inflation to ease, bottoming at 1.1 per cent in the fourth quarter. Total CPI inflation is expected to dip below zero for two quarters in 2009, reflecting year-on-year drops in energy prices. With inflation expectations well-anchored, total and core inflation should return to the 2 per cent target in the first half of 2011 as the economy returns to potential.\nAgainst this background, the Bank today lowered its policy rate by 50 basis points, bringing the cumulative monetary policy easing to 350 basis points since December 2007. Guided by Canada's inflation-targeting framework, the Bank will continue to monitor carefully economic and financial developments in judging to what extent further monetary stimulus will be required to achieve the 2 per cent target over the medium term. Low, stable, and predictable inflation is the best contribution monetary policy can make to long-term economic growth and financial stability.\nInformation note:\nA full update of the Bank's outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the Monetary Policy Report Update on 22 January 2009. The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is 3 March 2009.\n        "
"Bank of Canada releases Monetary Policy Report Update","\n            The Bank of Canada today released its January Monetary Policy Report Update, which discusses current economic and financial trends in the context of Canada's inflation-control strategy.\n\nIn the Update, the Bank noted that the outlook for the global economy has deteriorated since the October Monetary Policy Report, with the intensifying financial crisis spilling over into real economic activity. Heightened uncertainty is undermining business and household confidence worldwide and further eroding domestic demand. Major advanced economies, including Canada's, are now in recession, and emerging-market economies are increasingly affected. Commodity prices – especially energy prices – have fallen as a result of substantially weaker global demand.\n\nStabilization of the global financial system is a precondition for economic recovery. To that end, governments and central banks are taking bold and concerted policy actions. There are signs that these extraordinary measures are starting to gain traction, although it will take some time for financial conditions to normalize. In addition, considerable monetary and fiscal policy stimulus is being provided worldwide.\n\nThe Update notes that Canadian exports are down sharply, and domestic demand is shrinking as a result of declines in real income, household wealth, and confidence. Canada's economy is projected to contract through mid-2009, with real GDP dropping by 1.2 per cent this year on an annual average basis. As policy actions begin to take hold in Canada and globally, and with support from the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar, real GDP is expected to rebound, growing by 3.8 per cent in 2010.\n\nA wider output gap through 2009 and modest decreases in housing prices should cause core CPI inflation to ease, bottoming at 1.1 per cent in the fourth quarter.

With inflation expectations well-anchored, total and core inflation should return to the 2 per cent target in the first half of 2011 as the economy returns to potential.\n\nGlobal developments pose significant upside and downside risks to the inflation projection. On the upside, the global economy could be stronger, if global fiscal stimulus turns out to be more expansionary than expected, or if aggressive policy actions taken across major economies restore confidence more quickly than projected. On the downside, the global recession could be deeper and more protracted because financial conditions take longer to normalize. The Bank judges that the risks are roughly balanced.\n\nAgainst this background, the Bank lowered its policy rate by 50 basis points on Tuesday to 1 per cent, bringing the cumulative monetary policy easing to 350 basis points since December 2007. Guided by Canada's inflation-targeting framework, the Bank will continue to monitor carefully economic and financial developments in judging to what extent further monetary stimulus will be required to achieve the 2 per cent target over the medium term. Low, stable, and predictable inflation is the best contribution monetary policy can make to long-term economic growth and financial stability.\n        "

"Bank of Canada's continued focus on inflation right for current economic times: Governor Carney","\n            Canadians can be confident that monetary policy will maintain a \"relentless\" focus on controlling inflation, whether it rises above or drops below the official target range, Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said today.\n\nExperience has shown that controlling inflation is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to Canadians' economic and financial well-being, an issue that is particularly crucial during this period of extraordinary global financial turmoil, the Governor said in a speech to the Halifax Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\"In time, the global financial crisis will end, and the global economy will recover, although the speed with which this will happen is subject to a high degree of uncertainty,\" the Governor said. \"The relentless focus of monetary policy on inflation control is essential in this time of financial crisis and global recession, and remains the best contribution that monetary policy can make to the economic and financial welfare of Canada.\"\n\nGovernor Carney noted that the Bank's inflation-targeting framework, established jointly with the Government of Canada, takes a symmetrical approach to controlling inflation. This means that the Bank worries as much when inflation falls below the target of 2 per cent as when it rises above target, he said.\n\nAlthough the severe global financial crisis has raised concerns about deflation in some countries, the possibility of such a sustained fall in prices is remote in the Canadian economy for several reasons, said Governor Carney. Canada's labour, product, and capital markets are flexible; its banking system is one of the soundest in the world; and households, businesses, and the public sector have considerable financial flexibility. As well, Canada's floating exchange rate allows for an independent monetary policy which ensures that \"we are in control of our own monetary destiny,\" he said.\n\nMoreover, Canada has the clearest, most powerful monetary policy framework in the world. \"The advantages of that framework have been demonstrated, with inflation brought down and kept low and stable since the early 1990s, and they are equally relevant in times of disinflationary pressures,\" he said.\n\nThe Governor reiterated the Bank's economic projection as outlined in its Monetary Policy Report Update published on 22 January. Although economic activity in Canada is projected to decline this year, it should accelerate to above-potential growth in 2010, supported by policy actions and the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar. On an annual average basis, real GDP is projected to decline by 1.2 per cent in 2009 and to rebound by 3.8 per cent in 2010.\n        "
